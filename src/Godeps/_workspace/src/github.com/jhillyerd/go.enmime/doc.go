// Package enmime implements a MIME parsing library for Go.  It's built ontop
// of Go's included mime/multipart support, but is geared towards parsing MIME
// encoded emails.
//
// The basics:
//
// Calling ParseMIMEBody causes enmime to parse the body of the message object
// into a tree of MIMEPart objects, each of which is aware of its content
// type, filename and headers.  If the part was encoded in quoted-printable or
// base64, it is decoded before being stored in the MIMEPart object.
//
// ParseMIMEBody returns a MIMEBody struct.  The struct contains both the
// plain text and HTML portions of the email (if available).  The root of the
// tree, as well as slices of the email's inlines and attachments are
// available in the struct.
//
// If you need to locate a particular MIMEPart, you can pass a custom
// MIMEPartMatcher function into BreadthMatchFirst() or DepthMatchFirst() to
// search the MIMEPart tree.  BreadthMatchAll() and DepthMatchAll() will
// collect all matching parts.
//
// Please note that enmime parses messages into memory, so it is not likely to
// perform well with multi-gigabyte attachments.
//
// enmime is open source software released under the MIT License.  The latest
